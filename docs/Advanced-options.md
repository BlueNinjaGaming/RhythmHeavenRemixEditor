# Advanced Options

Advanced Options can be set by clicking the version text
five times or pressing `CTRL+A` in the Info and Settings screen.

You can enable/disable all of the Advanced Options.

If enabled, advanced features become available including these:

* All modding utilities (see Modding section)
* Characters per second tooltip on subtitle entities
* Button to copy list of games to clipboard in editor
* Button to convert selection to SFX Database json in editor
* Reloading the SFX Database on-the-fly

## Modding
If you're interested in modding certain Rhythm Heaven games,
there are even more tools available for you.

As of v3.17.0, modding metadata has become available. Extra modding-specific
info will appear on tooltips. If the current tool is the Ruler (press `R` in-editor), this info will
also appear on entities where appropriate.

Like with custom sounds, there is a `customModdingMetadata/` folder in the `~/.rhre3/` folder.
Identically named json files will overwrite stock ones.

In the Advanced Options menu, there is an option to switch RH games. Some RH games
are less supported than others, so make sure to pick appropriately for the game you're modding.
