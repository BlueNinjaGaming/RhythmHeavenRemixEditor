# Toolbar

![Entire toolbar](readme/toolbar/entire.png)

The toolbar is the topmost bar with various buttons on it.
You can hover over each button to see what they do, but each one's
functionality will be explored in more detail below.

## File I/O
![File I/O buttons](readme/toolbar/fileio.png)

The **New Remix**, **Open Remix**, and **Save Remix** buttons are
generally self-explanatory.

The **New Remix** button will ask you
if you want to start fresh. Be careful, because you cannot undo this!

The **Open Remix** button will ask you what remix file you'd like to open.
You can also open MIDI files (.mid) and load them in as Glee Club
sing cues by default. Be careful, because you will lose all unsaved changes.

The **Save Remix** button will ask you where to save your remix.

## Exporting
![Export button](readme/toolbar/export.png)

This will allow you to export your remixes as WAV, MP3, OGG (Vorbis), or FLAC
files, as long as you have placed an End Remix entity.

[See this article for more info.](Exporting)

## Undo/Redo
![Undo and redo buttons](readme/toolbar/undoredo.png)

These buttons allow you to undo and redo most actions, respectively.
Keyboard shortcuts are **`CTRL+Z`** for undoing, and **`CTRL+Y`**/**`CTRL+SHIFT+Z`** for redoing.

## Music Select, Metronome, and Tapalong
![Music Select, Metronome, and Tapalong](readme/toolbar/tapalong.png)

The first button allows you to select the music. Right clicking on the
button will mute the music temporarily.

The metronome button toggles the metronome. It also ticks at a higher pitch
for the start of each measure (if defined).

The tapalong button brings up a menu to help you find the BPM of your
music.

## Scroll Mode
![Scroll mode](readme/toolbar/scrollmode.png)

This button allows you to toggle what action scrolling (or pressing up and down)
does on a selection. By default, it changes the pitch. An alternative mode
is changing the volume.

[See this section for more details](Readme#scroll-mode)

## Change Track Size
![Change track size](readme/toolbar/changetrack.png)

This button allows you to change how many lines, or rows are available
on the track. Left click to increase the size, and right click to decrease
the size. Be careful! You cannot decrease the row count if cues are
in the way. When this happens, right clicking the button will go to the
impeding entity, and select it for you.

## Playalong
![Playalong](readme/toolbar/playalong.png)

[Playalong mode is covered in its own article here.](Playalong.md)

Right clicking this button will open the Playalong Settings, where you can change the control
scheme and calibrate for input lag.

## Playback
![Playback buttons](readme/toolbar/playback.png)

The playback buttons are self-explanatory.
Pressing play will start the remix from the [Playback Start](README#playback-start)
marker (or from where it was paused). <br>
Pressing pause will pause the remix, and pressing play again will continue playback.
Pressing stop will stop the remix and reset its position to the Playback Start marker.

## Jump to Beat and Snap Intervals
![Left: Jump to Beat field | Right: Snap Intervals](readme/toolbar/jumpto.png)

The first element is a text field. Type in a beat number to jump straight to it.

The second element is a button. Left click to change the snap intervals to increasingly
smaller increments (wraps around to 1/4), and right click to set it to 1/4.

## Presentation Mode, Views, and Theme Chooser
![Left: Presentation Mode | Middle: Views | Right: Theme Chooser](readme/toolbar/views.png)

The left button is the Presentation Mode button. Use this mode when
recording a remix for use on a video sharing site.
A progress bar will appear, with credits and a link to the project's
GitHub page, along with the current game being played and the current BPM.
Certain entities will be hidden from view for neatness.

The button with an eye on it is the Views menu. You can select different view types there.
<br>[See this section for more details.](README#views)

The button with the colour palettes is the Theme Chooser. You can pick
from a variety of pre-built themes, or make your own.
**`RIGHT CLICK`** this button to toggle between solid-colour backgrounds and (animated) menu backgrounds.
<br>[See this article for more details.](Themes)

## Window settings
![Left: Reset Window | Right: Fullscreen](readme/toolbar/window.png)

The left button resets the window to the default size. It will also
revert the program to be in windowed mode if it was in fullscreen previously.

The right button puts the program in fullscreen, if possible.

## Language, News, Info and Settings
![Left: Language | Middle: News | Right: Info and Settings](readme/toolbar/info.png)

The left button cycles through the languages (right click goes in reverse).
Note: all localizations are not 100% accurate. We appreciate corrections
and suggestions!

The middle button goes to the News screen. Here you can stay updated with
the latest RHRE and custom remixing news.

The right button goes to the Info and Settings screen. From there you can change
some settings, and view update info and the credits.
