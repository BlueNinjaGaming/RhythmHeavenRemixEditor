# Code of Conduct

We as users, members, and contributors agree to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We strive to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes positively to our 
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  community as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Insulting or derogatory comments
* Personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful, at their own discretion.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
contributions that may not be aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported at `conduct[at]rhre.dev`.

Community leaders may determine appropriate actions at their own discretion
when determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.
