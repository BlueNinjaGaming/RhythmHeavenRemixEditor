# Making issues
The Issue tracker is NOT your personal support forum. It is generally intended to report
bugs and feature requests. Please also keep to the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

When making an issue, please keep to the [templates already provided](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). All
you have to do is submit a log file using the upload function, state the
version affected, and describe your problem. Failing to keep to this template
will have your issue closed almost immediately, and you may be blocked from creating issues in the future.

If submitting a feature request, state the version and description only.
(You do not need a log file or the behaviours section.)

Please make your titles descriptive of the problem/feature.
#### Good titles
* Shake entity shows pitch when hovered over
  * Short and to the point
* Response copies on macOS don't work
  * Also short and to the point
* Pie charts on inspections general stats screen should be percentage of time used and not count
  * While a bit verbose, it still conveys its point
* Music Volume Beyond 100%/Change Volume of Specific Cues
  * This is a good feature request title -- short and to the point

#### Bad titles
* Rap Women needs to have better segmenting AND has offbeat patterns
  * Issues are not **demands**.
* I think there might be another language for Love Rap you're missing...
  * I don't hide things. Again, issues are not demands.
* How to install it?!
  * Issues are not your personal support forum. This is not helpful.
* It wont let me open the file to use it
  * Sounds like "I can't do the thing and it won't let me do it". This is not descriptive.
